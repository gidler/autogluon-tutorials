    "# CLIP in AutoMM - Zero-Shot Image Classification \n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to classify an image to different classes, it is standard to train an image classifier based on the class names. However, it is tedious to collect training data. And if the collected data is too few or too imbalanced, you may not get a decent image classifier. So you wonder, is there a strong enough model that can handle this situaton without the training efforts? \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually there is! OpenAI has introduced a model named [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/), which can be applied to any visual classification benchmark by simply providing the names of the visual categories to be recognized. And its accuracy is high, e.g., CLIP can achieve 76.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet without using any of the 1.28M training samples. This performance matches with original supervised ResNet50 on ImageNet, quite promising for a classification task with 1000 classes!\n",

    "So in this tutorial, let's dive deep into CLIP. We will show you how to use CLIP model to do zero-shot image classification in AutoGluon. \n"

    "This is amazing, right? Now a bit knowledge on why and how CLIP works. CLIP is called Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training. It is trained on a massive number of data (400M image-text pairs). By using a simple loss objective, CLIP tries to predict which out of a set of randomly sampled text is actually paired with an given image in the training dateset. As a result, CLIP models can then be applied to nearly arbitrary visual classification tasks just like the examples we have shown above.\n"

    "## More about CLIP\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIP is powerful, and it was designed to mitigate a number of major problems in the standard deep learning approach to computer vision, such as costly datasets, closed set prediction and poor generalization performance. CLIP is a good solution to many problems, however, it is not the ultimate solution. CLIP has its own limitations. For example, CLIP is vulnerable to typographic attacks, i.e., if you add some text to an image, CLIP's predictions will be easily affected by the text. Let's see one example from OpenAI's blog post on [multimodal neurons](https://openai.com/blog/multimodal-neurons/). \n",
